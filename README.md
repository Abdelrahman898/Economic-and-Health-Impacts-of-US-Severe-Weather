# Economic-and-Health-Impacts-of-US-Severe-Weather

# Synopsis

In this project, we analyze the storm database taken from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We estimate the fatalities, injuries, property damage, and crop damage for each type of event (e.g., Flood, Typhoon, Tornado, Hail, Hurricane, etc.). Our goal is to determine which event is most harmful to US population (health) and which event has the largest economic consequences. Our analysis on Fatalities and Injuries conclude that Tornado is the most harmful event in respect to the US Population Health. On the other hand, based on the Property and Cost damage, we conclude that Flood has the greatest economic consequences to the US.


# Introduction
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. You must use the database to answer the questions below and show the code for your entire analysis. Your analysis can consist of tables, figures, or other summaries. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

# Questions

- Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
- Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
